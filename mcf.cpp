 *
 * (1) Check that each output pin is relevant.
 *     An output pin is relevant *iff* there are inputs x, y such that the
 *     output pin has different states in f(x), f(y).  This eliminates functions
 *     with constant output pins.
 *
 * (2) Two output pins a, b are independent *iff* there are inputs x, y such
 *     that the output pins have different states when representing f(x), f(y).
 *     This eliminates functions with redundant output pins.  Note that due to
 *     f(0) == 0 (see constructor of class 'function') it is already impossible
 *     that x is always the exact opposite of y (and thus redundant in a
 *     different way).
 *     Yeah, this property is also implied by "metastability-containing and no
 *     constant pins", but it can be detected here trivially and makes the
 *     following easier to implement:
 *
 * (3) Consider two output pins a, b.  Let ONE(a) and ONE(b) each be the first
 *     input-pattern that cause a and b respectively to be in the "on" state.
 *     Note that ONE(a) != ONE(b), because otherwise it can't possibly be
 *     metastability-containing anymore.  Define the order of output bits to be
 *     the *reverse* order of ONE(a), ONE(b).  Only allow functions where the
 *     output pins are ordered according to this definition.
 *     This eliminates the inherent combinatorial explosion, and leaves only
 *     semantically distinct functions.

         * "distributing it", i.e., each input pattern introduces exactly one
         * first-one.  However, the second pattern is adjacent to the first
         * pattern, so it must also contain the one introduced by the first.
         * Furthermore, the second pattern must be also adjacent to another
         * input pattern (as the ...0 pattern can't have been all zeros, because
         * by construction f(0)=0, and the ...0 pattern introduces a one).
         * This earlier pattern can't possibly contain either 1 because it
         * appeared first in the outputs to the ..0 and ..1 patterns,
         * respectively.  Thus the ..1 pattern and the other input pattern
         * differ in only one bit, but their outputs in (at least) two bits.
         * Violation to metastability-containment!
         *
         * So, given 'runway', we can fit at most round_up(runway / 2)
         * first-ones.  As we can see in README.md#statistics, this bound seems
         * to be tight; at least for #out <= 16. */
